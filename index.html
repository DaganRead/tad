Sharps injuries are occupational hazards frequently encountered by medical professionals who handle needles. These injuries pose the risk of transmitting bloodborne pathogens such as the hepatitis B virus (HBV), the hepatitis C virus (HCV), as well as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Needlestick injuries are common events in the healthcare environment;Mario Saia et al¹ in 2010 reported an estimated 384,000 cases in the USA alone.¹Hollow needle injuries are especially dangerous and carry a very high risk of transmitting bloodborne diseases. Infected material coming into contact with a mucus membrane (e.g., blood splashing into the eye) also carries a risk of transmitting disease.<br/><b>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) </b>guidelines and recommendationsregarding the use of needles, cannulas, and intravenous delivery systems:<br/><ul><li>Use aseptic techniques to avoid contamination of sterile injection equipment.</li><li>Do not administer medications from the same syringe to more than one patient, even if the needle or cannula on the syringe has been changed. Needles, cannulas, and syringes are sterile, single&#45;use items;they should neither be reused for another patient nor to access a medication or solution that might be used for a subsequent patient.</li><li>Use fluid infusion and administration sets (i.e., intravenous bags, tubing, and connectors) for one patient only and then dispose of them appropriately. Once a syringe or needle/cannula has been used to enter or connect a patients intravenous infusion bag or administration set, consider it contaminated.</li><li>Use single&#45;dose vials for parenteral medications whenever possible.</li><li>Do not administer medications from single&#45;dose vials or ampules to multiple patients or combine leftover contents.</li><li>If multi&#45;dose vials must be used, both the needle or cannula and syringe used to access the multi&#45;dose vial must be sterile.</li><li>Do not keep multi&#45;dose vials in the immediate patient treatment area and store in accordance with the manufacturers recommendations;discard if sterility is compromised or questionable.</li><li>Do not use bags or bottles of intravenous solution as a common supply source for several patients.</li></ul><br/> Download CDC Posters on preventing injuries with sharps:<br/><a href=http://www.cdc.gov/sharpssafety/pdf/sharpssafety_poster1.pdf><b>[Poster 1 hyperlink]</b></a><a href=http://www.cdc.gov/sharpssafety/pdf/sharpssafety_poster2.pdf><b>[Poster 2</b><b>hyperlink]</b></a><a href=http://www.cdc.gov/sharpssafety/pdf/sharpssafety_poster3.pdf><b>[Poster 3</b><b>hyperlink]</b></a><div><a href=http://www.cdc.gov/sharpssafety/><b>Study CDC guidelines for handling sharps</b></a><b>²</b></div> Look at the <b>WHO Publication</b> on sharps injuries:<br/><a href=http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/en/sharps.pdf><b>Assessing the burden of disease from sharps injuries to health care workers at national and local levels.</b></a><b>³</b>All students, especially those in USA, should acquaint themselves with the relevant legalities in the <b>OSHA Occupational Safety &amp;Health Administration&#39;s documents:</b><ul><li>Read <a title=OSHAs Workers href=http://www.osha.gov/workers.html>OSHAs Workers</a> page,</li><li><a href=http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/bloodbornepathogens/>Bloodborne Pathogens and Needlestick Preventions</a> and <a href=http://www.osha.goveedlestickseedlefaq.html>http://www.osha.goveedlestickseedlefaq.html</a></li></ul>In the USA, the <b>Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act of 2000</b> makes the use of &#39;engineered sharps injury protection&#39; mandatory in the workplace. In practice, it means that safety needles and safety devices are compulsory in the USA and in a number of other countries.<br/>In order to reduce or eliminate the hazards of occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens, an employer must implement an exposure control plan for the worksite with details on employee protection measures. The plan must describe how the employer will use a combination of engineering and work practice controls. Among other provisions, the employer must ensure the use of personal protective clothing and equipment and provide training, medical surveillance, hepatitis B vaccinations, as well as signs and labels. Engineering controls are the primary means of eliminating or minimizing employee exposure and include the use of safer medical devices, such as needleless devices, shielded needle devices, and plastic capillary tubes.<br/><b>[See Act here: USA Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act of 2000</b><b>] </b><br/><br/><b>IMPORTANT!<br/></b>If you are injured or pricked by a needle or other sharp object or get blood or other potentially infectious materials in your eyes, nose, mouth or on broken skin, immediately flood the exposed area with water and clean any wound with soap and water or a skin disinfectant if available.

Blood is the fluid that circulates through the heart, arteries, capillaries, and veins and is the chief means of transport within the body. It transports oxygen from the lungs to the body tissues, and carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs. It transports nutritive substances and metabolites to the tissues and removes waste products to the kidneys and other organs of excretion. It has an essential role in maintaining fluid balance. The total blood volume of an adult varies between 5&#45;6 liters for males and 4&#45;5 liters for females.<br/><b>Whole blood </b>is blood drawn from the body from which no constituent, such as plasma or platelets, has been removed.<br/><b>Blood fractionation</b> is the process of fractionating whole blood, or separating it into its component parts. This is typically done with a centrifuge.<br/><table class=imageTable style=float:none!important;><tr><td><b>Figure 3a:</b> A typical hematology lab centrifuge apparatus</td><td><b>Figure 3b:</b> Centrifuged blood in tube</td></tr><tr><td><img src=images/venipuncture/3.jpg></td><td><img src=images/venipuncture/4.jpg></td></tr></table><br/> Blood can be separated into 3 layers by a process of centrifugation (fast spinning of blood filled tubes in a laboratory apparatus called a centrifuge).<br/>1. The upper yellowish layer is blood plasma.<br/>2. The thin, middle, buffy layer is white blood cells, as well as blood platelets.<br/>3. The bottom layer is packed erythrocytes, or red blood cells.<br/><br/><b>Blood plasma: </b><br/>The liquid phase of the blood, obtained by sedimentation or centrifugation of blood treated with an anticoagulant (anti&#45;clotting agent).<br/>Plasma is mostly fluid, consisting mainly of water, as well as three specific types of proteins (albumin, globulins, and fibrinogen), dissolved salts (ions), food nutrients, waste products, hormones, vitamins, and dissolved gasses (oxygen and carbon dioxide).<br/>Albumin&#39;s main function is to prevent water from leaving the capillaries ─ thus albumin holds water inside the intravascular space.<br/>Globulins are mainly the immune system&#39;s antibodies.<br/>Fibrinogen plays a major role in blood clotting.<br/>Blood serum is blood plasma without fibrinogen or the other clotting factors.<br/><br/><b>Blood cells</b><br/><br/>If a drop of human blood is thinly smeared across a microscopy slide, you can see various different blood cells. The pink roundish structures with white centers are the erythrocytes (red blood cells).<table class=imgTable ><tr><td><b>Figure 4a:</b> A normal blood smear</td></tr><tr><td><img src=images/venipuncture/5.jpg></td></tr></table>Blood cells include red blood cells, a variety of white blood cells (lymphocytes, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, and monocytes), and blood platelets.<br/>Leukocytes include the following white blood cells: lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes.Blood platelets are small cell fragments that play an essential role in the blood clotting process. The buffy layer between the plasma and red blood cells contains all the white blood cells, as well as the blood platelets.<br/><b>Packed red blood cells</b><br/> are red blood cells that have been separated from whole blood for transfusions. Packed red blood cells (RBCs) essentially contain the same amount of hemoglobin as whole blood, but most of the plasma has been removed.<br/><br/><b>Erythrocytes (red blood cells/RBCs)</b><br/><br/>Erythrocytes are biconcave in shape for two good reasons:<br/><ul><li>Flexibility. It&#39;s a very flexible cell that can fold or bend to go through small capillaries.</li><li>Large surface area. RBCs are designed for one main purpose: to carry O2 from the lungs to the tissue cells and CO2 from tissue to the lungs. RBCs perform this dedicated function for &#177; 120 days and then the spleen and liver removes them from the bloodstream. A mature RBC has neither a nucleus nor any other organelles. It&#39;s packed mostly with large numbers of hemoglobin molecules. This maximizes the cell&#39;s oxygen&#45;carrying ability. The biconcave shape increases its surface area to ensure optimal gas exchange.</li></ul><br/><br/><b>Hemoglobin</b><br/><br/>Hemoglobin has four protein chains, and each protein chain is called a globin. Hemoglobin consists of four contorted protein globin chains, two Apha and two Beta.<table class=imgTable ><tr><td><b>Figure 4b:</b> A graphic illustration of hemoglobin</td></tr><tr><td><img src=images/venipuncture/7.jpg></td></tr></table>A heme is ring shaped molecule with an iron ion (Fe+2). Oxygen has a high affinity to the heme ion. Each hemoglobin molecule has four hemes;each heme provides a place to carry an oxygen molecule. So each hemoglobin molecule can carry four oxygen molecules. Every single red blood cell is packed with 280 million hemoglobin molecules. It follows that one red blood cell could carry about one billion oxygen molecules!<br/><br/><b>Hematology: </b><br/><br/>Hematology is the study concerned with the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases of the blood and bone marrow, as well as of the immunologic, hemostatic (blood clotting) and vascular systems.

However, in the following discussion we will exclusively focus on the use of tourniquets to reduce or stop the venous return of blood to the heart for a period of time.<br/><br/></div>A venous tourniquet is usually applied 7&#45;10 cm (3&#45;4 inches) above the intended venipuncture point on either the upper or lower extremity. The idea behind applying a tourniquet is to minimize the flow of venous blood back to the heart while allowing the arterial blood to flow undisturbed to the extremity. Blood will thus fill and distend the veins due to their fairly thin and collapsible walls. Then the veins are easier to see and feel, thus making venipuncture easier to perform without complications. Pressure exerted by the tourniquet must be high enough to stop or impede the venous return to the heart, but low enough to allow free arterial blood&#45;flow, about 45&#45;65 mmHg (millimeters Mercury).<br/>From a hygienic point of view, a disposable tourniquet is the best option, as each one is discarded after a single&#45;use. Disadvantages may include cost and secondly you must be careful of latex allergies, as these tourniquets are often made of latex. Affordable latex&#45;free disposable tourniquets (like the one in your kit) are available and recommended.<br/>Reusable tourniquets should be properly laundered at regular intervals and after any suspected contamination. Enquire about this at your hospital&#39;s infection control section.","requirements":"<b>You will need:<br/></b><ul><li>A volunteer test patient</li><li>One disposable (latex&#45;free) tourniquet</li><li>A re&#45;usable tourniquet</li><li>A blood pressure cuff (if you have one available)</li></ul>","steps":"<b>Follow these steps for drawing blood from the cubital fossa area:<br/><br/> <span style=text-decoration: underline;>Step 1</span></b><br/>Take a short medical history, especially regarding allergies (latex, Iodine and IV drugs, etc.).The tourniquet and gloves in this kit are latex&#45;free.<br/><br/><b><span style=text-decoration: underline;>Step 2</span></b><br/>Remove clothing from the arm up to the middle of the upper arm.

Once the blood has passed from the arteries through the capillaries, it flows at a slower rate because little pressure remains to move the blood along towards the heart. In the veins below the heart, blood flow is facilitated by muscular contraction. When the muscles contract, blood within the veins is squeezed forward in the vein and the valves open.

A safe injection does not harm the recipient, does not expose the provider to any avoidable risks, and does not result in waste that is dangerous for the community (e.g., through inappropriate disposal of injection equipment). Injection safety includes practices intended to prevent transmission of infectious diseases between one patient and another, for example between a patient and healthcare provider, and also to prevent harm such as needlestick injuries.<ul><li>What is aseptic technique?</li></ul>In this context, aseptic technique refers to the manner of handling, preparing, and storing of medications and injection equipment/supplies (e.g., syringes, needles and IV tubing) to prevent microbial contamination.<ul><li>What are some of the unsafe injection practices that have resulted in transmission of pathogens?</li></ul>The most common practices that have resulted in transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and/or other pathogens include:<ul><li>Using the same syringe to administer medication to more than one patient, even if the needle was changed or the injection was administered through an intervening length of intravenous (IV) tubing;</li><li>Accessing a medication vial or bag with a syringe that has already been used to administer medication to a patient then reusing contents from that vial or bag for another patient;</li><li>Using medications packaged as single&#45;dose or single&#45;use for more than one patient;</li><li>Failing to use aseptic technique when preparing and administering injections.</li><li>What are some procedures that have been associated with unsafe injection practices?</li></ul>Unsafe injection practices that put patients at risk for HBV, HCV, and other infections have been identified during various types of procedures. Examples include:<ul><li>Administration of sedatives and anesthetics for surgical, diagnostic, and pain management procedures;</li><li>Administration of IV medications for chemotherapy, cosmetic procedures, and alternative medicine therapies;</li><li>Use of saline solutions to flush IV lines and catheters;</li><li>Administration of intramuscular (IM) vaccines.<br/></li></ul>The medications used in these procedures were in single&#45;dose or single&#45;use vials, multi&#45;dose vials, and bags.

These microbes (also called flora) can be divided into two groups: resident flora (lives in and on the skin) and transient flora (temporary visitor microorganisms). Resident and transient flora do not normally cause diseases on the skin but if they enter the body they may cause diseases. For example, <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i> lives quite innocently on the skin in great numbers but may cause sub&#45;acute bacterial endocarditis (SBE) under certain conditions if they enter the blood stream.<br/>It is impossible to sterilize (kill all known microorganisms and spores) on a patient&#39;s skin but one can reduce and weaken these skin bacteria to the extent that it would be unlikely for them to cause problems. Isopropyl alcohol is the most common substance used for this purpose when performing venipuncture/phlebotomy procedures.<br/>Isopropyl alcohol is a colorless, flammable chemical compound with a strong odor with the molecular formula C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O. It is used in medical disinfecting pads (alcohol preps), which typically contain a 60–70&#37; solution of isopropyl alcohol in water. It kills bacteria by causing each bacterium cell membrane to lose its structural integrity.

They are especially useful when doing venipuncture on patients with spastic, thin, or &#39;rolling&#39; veins. Winged needles are most commonly used when the available veins are very small, fragile, and difficult to access or when veins are in a location that would make a standard evacuated tube system difficult to use. Winged needles are also used on very shallow veins because the design allows the needle to be inserted at a much shallower angle (10ᆣ&#176;) compared to a standard evacuated tube system. Winged needles are nearly always used when drawing blood from the hand, wrist, or other places where veins are very close to the skin.<br/>Due to the fact that the winged needle is attached to a flexible tube, there is less chance of the needle slipping out or perforating the deep end of the vein. This can happen if either the patient or the phlebotomist moves during the procedure, especially when drawing blood for multiple tubes. Winged needles are usually 21g (green label) or 23g (blue label). Rarely, a 25g (orange label) is used, mostly in pediatrics or in very difficult cases;a needle of such small diameter may cause hemolysis, thus invalidating test results.<br/>The needle is held by the &#39;wings&#39; and placed into the vein, generally at a fairly shallow angle. The wings allow the phlebotomist to grasp the needle very close to the end to ensure accurate insertion into a vein. When the needle enters the lumen of a vein a &#39;flash of blood&#39; can be seen. The flash is a small amount of blood that flows back into the tubing when the needle enters a vein. The phlebotomist can then push vacuum tubes into the hub or use a syringe to draw blood.","requirements":"<b>You will need:</b><br/><ul><li>Laboratory specimen labels</li><li>Pen for writing</li><li>Laboratory forms</li><li>The sharps container</li><li>Alcohol wipe</li><li>Clean gloves</li><li>Clean work surface cover</li><li>Winged infusion set–21 gauge</li><li>Syringe (10ml or 20ml)</li><li>Cotton wool or gauze square</li><li>Strapping (adhesive bandage strip)</li><li>Fully setup Venipuncture Trainer—see <b>PROJECT 10A </b></li></ul>Phlebotomist, in addition to the above items, will also need leak&#45;proof transportation bags and containers.","steps":"<b>Follow these steps as if in a real&#45;life clinical situation then simulate drawing blood using the Venipuncture Trainer: </b><br/><br/><b><span style=text-decoration: underline;>Step 1</span></b><br/>Greet, identify, position and prepare the patient, and then ask relevant medical questions.

It is commonly referred to as a &#39;drip&#39; because many systems of administration employ a drip chamber, which allows an estimation of flow rate and prevents air from entering the blood stream. (Air entering the blood stream can lead to an air embolism.) Intravenous therapy is used as a method of delivering medications to correct electrolyte imbalances for blood transfusions, and for replacing fluid to correct dehydration. The IV route is the fastest manner in which to deliver fluids and medications to the body.<br/>A peripheral cannula is commonly used for intravenous access. It consists of a short catheter inserted through the skin into a peripheral vein. This is usually in the form of a flexible plastic &#34;cannula over a needle&#34; device. Once the tip of the needle and cannula are located in the vein the needle is withdrawn and discarded and the cannula is then advanced inside the vein and secured into position with tape.","requirements":"<b>You will need:</b><br/><ul><li>The sharps container</li><li>Alcohol wipe</li><li>Clean gloves</li><li>Clean work surface cover</li><li>Cotton wool or gauze square</li><li>Strapping</li><li>Transparent dressing</li><li>IV catheters 18 or 20 or 22 gauge</li><li>IV fluid stand (something to hang the IV bag from &#45; about 3 feet/1 meter above your work area level)</li><li>IV fluid bag</li><li>IV tubing</li><li>The Venipuncture Trainer (modified setup required).

This was at first through the umbilical vein, but the frequency of complications lead to other central and peripheral routes being used for infusion of fluid, nutrients and drugs. Today, peripheral venous access is preferred except for high volume fluid resuscitation, reliable infusion of irritant drugs and long&#45;term parenteral nutrition. Intraosseous infusion provides a reliable alternative to peripheral veins for rapid infusion of fluid. Long, thin silastic catheters can be inserted through a peripheral venous cannulae for parenteral nutrition or other central venous infusions as an alternative to direct central venous cannulation using the Seldinger or other techniques. Broviac or Hickman catheters, inserted through a subcutaneous tunnel are only considered when central venous cannulation is likely to be needed for more than six weeks. The most common serious complication of vascular access is infection. Infection associated with central venous catheters is reduced by prophylactic vancomycin or teicoplanin. Other complications of central venous infusion are associated with cannulae malpositioning, bleeding and thrombosis. Distal hypoperfusion may follow arterial cannulation. Modern emergency and intensive care paediatrics is impossible without adequate venous and arterial vascular access;however, no other skill for neonatal intensive care causes more anxiety among primary care providers, is more difficult to teach and is associated with an increased risk of median nerve injury.</i>For the complete article &#45; <a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10150755><b>[Click Here]</b></a><br/><br/><b>The pediatric patient</b><br/>The basic principles of phlebotomy and venipuncture in the pediatric patient are similar to the adult patient yet differ quite a bit.<br/>The key to successful venipuncture lies with the restrainer (parent or fellow medical professional).Look at the recommended technique as suggested by WHO:<br/><a href=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2010/9789241599221_eng.pdf><b>WHO guidelines on drawing blood: Best practices in phlebotomy</b></a><br/><b>⁷</b>Especially read the section on &#34;Practical guidance on pediatric and neonatal blood Sampling&#34; pages 35&#45;40.This is a must read for any medical professional working with pediatric patients:Difficult Venous Access in Children: Taking Control by Laura L. et al.⁹Download this excellent article: <a href=http://www.tmh.org/workfiles/journalclub/journalClubArticle.pdf><b>[Click Here] </b></a><br/><br/><b>VETERINARY VENIPUNCTURE</b><br/><br/><b>The animal patient</b><br/><br/>The basic principles of performing venipuncture procedures on the animal patient are the same as for the human patient.<br/>Generalized differences include:<br/><ul><li>Most animals do have fur or lots of hair covering the areas with veins suitable for venipuncture.

The most significant Rh antigen is the D antigen. You either have it or you don&#39;t. The person who has the D antigen is positive and one who doesn&#39;t is negative. So, someone could be Type A, B, AB, or O, and then Rh positive or negative (e.g., A Rh+ or B Rh&#45;). An Rh+ person can donate blood ONLY to another Rh+ person while an Rh&#45; person can donate blood to both an Rh+, as well as an Rh&#45; person.<br/>Rh factor is especially important in pregnant women. Let&#39;s say a woman is Rh&#45; and the Rh+ father gave the baby the genes to be Rh+ as well. This will be fine, as the baby&#39;s blood isn&#39;t mixing with the mothers or vice&#45;versa. When it becomes important is when she gives birth to the baby because there&#39;s a break in the blood systems and small tears cause some of the blood cells from the baby to cross over into the mother&#39;s bloodstream during birth, which causes the mother&#39;s immune system to recognize those Rh antigens. The Rh&#45;negative mother will produce Rh antibodies upon exposure to Rh&#45;factor. If the next baby is Rh+ again, the mother&#39;s anti&#45;Rh antibodies can cross over to the baby&#39;s system and attack the baby&#39;s red blood cells, often ending in the demise of the baby. The RhoGAM injection was created to minimize Rh&#45;factor incompatibility reaction with consecutive pregnancies. It is given to the mother within 72 hours of birth to kill the Rh+ cells that have crossed into her blood stream to prevent her from making Rh antibodies.<br/><b>Agglutination reaction (clumping test)</b><br/>Should a medical professional infuse the wrong blood type to somebody by accident, the result will be that blood will agglutinate (create clumps of red blood cells followed by serious life threatening complications). It is important to test the blood from the donor and the recipient by mixing a small amount in a test tube or on a glass slide to test for compatibility. Agglutination will be noted if the bloods are incompatible. Type O Rh&#45; blood can be given to anybody because there&#39;s nothing on the blood cells for the person to attack. A person with type O Rh&#45; blood is considered a &#34;Universal donor&#34; and any person in any other blood group may receive type O Rh&#45; blood. A person with type AB Rh+ blood carries both A, B, and D (Rh) antigens but neither A nor B nor D antibodies and can therefore receive anyone&#39;s blood (types A or B or AB or O blood &#45; Rh+ or Rh&#45;) because they don&#39;t have antibodies to fight antigens. Type AB is known as a &#34;Universal recipient&#34;.<br/> <table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tbody><tr><td valign=top width=84><b>Recipient</b></td><td colspan=8 valign=top width=671><p

Saliva is secreted by the six major salivary glands (the paired parotids, submandibular, and sublingual glands), as well as the multiple hundreds of minor salivary glands situated within the submucosa of the lips, cheeks, and palate.<br/>The laboratory testing of saliva samples is a fairly new and exciting field of clinical pathology, measuring various hormones, biochemical substances, drugs, etc. It has a number of applications in forensic medicine as well.<br/>Saliva testing has many advantages over blood testing. Saliva specimen collection does not require a blood draw and there are no risks to patients. Saliva collections are convenient and can be done at work or at home. When stored properly, saliva samples are stable for several weeks.<br/>With an accuracy of 92&#45;96&#37;, saliva testing is as accurate as blood testing and, in some cases, more accurate. Another advantage of saliva testing is the ability to collect specimens over a period of time with ease. This offers providers more information than a single collection would. Compared to blood testing, saliva testing is also more affordable.<br/><br/><b>Sputum</b><br/>Sputum refers more to the mucous substance secreted by the mucous glands in the throat and upper airways (nasal mucosa, trachea, bronchi, and bronchiole). Sputum needs to be coughed up and spit out by the patient into a specimen collection container. Sputum is usually sent to the microbiology lab and is especially useful in the diagnosis of tuberculosis (deep early morning sputum collected three consecutive days).<br/><div align=center><hr align=center size=2 width=100%/></div><b>Breast milk </b><br/>Breast milk may be analyzed for nutritional composition/values. Measured nutritional components are glucose, lactose, triglyceride, and protein.

It is used to screen for cystic fibrosis (CF).Sweating is stimulated by applying a colorless, odorless chemical that causes sweating. An electrode is applied over a circumscribed area of the body for about five minutes. Sweat is collected on a piece of filter paper and then sent to the laboratory for testing. Increased chlorine levels will make the diagnosis of CF &#39;unlikely&#39;, &#39;possible&#39;, or &#39;likely&#39;, depending on the specific level.<br/><br/><div align=center><hr align=center size=2 width=100%/></div><b>SHORT NOTES ON OTHER BODILY EXCRETIONS</b><br/><br/><b>Urine</b><br/>Urine tests are very useful for providing information to assist in the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of a wide range of diseases and conditions. Hormonal levels in the urine test can indicate whether a woman is ovulating or pregnant.Urine can also be tested for a variety of substances, including illegal drug use in general, as well as in the world of professional sport.Urine may be submitted to the cytology lab to detect cancerous cells or to the microbiology lab for microscopy and culturing to identify specific microbes involved in urinary tract infections.<br/><br/><b>Urinalysis:</b><br/>The urine can be tested very quickly using a strip of special paper, which is dipped in urine just after urination. This will show if there are any abnormal products in the urine such as sugar, protein, or blood.If more tests are needed to get more details, the urine will be analyzed at a laboratory.Normally urine is sterile, but skin contaminant bacteria may be added to the sample during urination.The patient should be instructed to wash genital areas before taking the sample, specifically taking the &#39;mid&#45;stream&#39; urine.A urine sample for the lab is collected in a standard lab collection container (100&#45;150 ml required).<br/><br/><div align=center><hr align=center size=2 width=100%/></div><b>Feces</b><br/>A doctor may order a stool collection to test for a variety of possible conditions, for example to:<ul><li>Evaluate certain allergies, such as milk protein allergy in infants.</li><li>Assist with identifying diseases of the digestive tract, liver, and pancreas.</li><li>Screen for colon cancer by checking for hidden (occult) blood.</li><li>Examine for the presence of parasites, such as pinworms or Giardia lamblia.</li><li>Ascertain the cause of an infection, such as bacteria (e.g., Salmonella, Shigella, fungi, and viruses).</li><li>Assist with finding the cause of symptoms affecting the digestive tract, including prolonged diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, increased flatulence, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, bloating, abdominal pain, cramping, and fever.</li><li>Check for poor absorption of nutrients by the digestive tract (malabsorption syndrome).</li></ul> A fresh stool sample is collected in a sterile container.

It is commonly obtained by a procedure called a lumbar puncture. Lumbar puncture is performed in an attempt to count the cells in the fluid and to detect the levels of biochemical constituents like protein and glucose. These parameters alone may be extremely beneficial in the diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage and central nervous system infections such as encephalitis and meningitis. Microbiological CSF culture examination may yield the specific microorganism causing the infection.By using more sophisticated methods, such as the detection of the oligoclonal bands, conditions like multiple sclerosis may be recognized.Beta&#45;2 transferrin is almost exclusively found in the cerebrospinal fluid. It is not found in blood, mucus, or tears, thus making it a specific marker of cerebrospinal fluid and the detection of leakage like CSF rhinorrhea.<table class=imgTable ><tr><td><b>Figure 44:</b> Cerebrospinal fluid fills the ventricles and surrounds the brain and spinal cord</td></tr><tr><td><img src=images/venipuncture/59.jpg></td></tr></table>.<br/><br/><b>Ascites</b> is an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity. It is most commonly caused by severe liver disease, like cirrhosis or metastatic liver cancer, but its presence may also indicate other important medical conditions. Diagnosis of the cause is usually done with blood tests, an ultrasound scan of the abdomen, and direct removal of the fluid by needle (paracentesis). Treatment may be with medication (diuretics), paracentesis, or other treatments directed at the cause.<br/>Diagnostic blood tests should include a complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic profile, liver enzymes, and coagulation profile. Most experts recommend a diagnostic paracentesis be performed;the fluid is then examined for its gross appearance, protein level, albumin, and cell counts (red and white). Additional tests will be performed if indicated, such as Gram stain and cytopathology.<br/>The Serum&#45;Ascites Albumin Gradient (SAAG) is probably a better discriminant than older measures for discerning the causes of ascites. A high gradient indicates the ascites is due to portal hypertension, while a low gradient points away from portal hypertension as the primary etiology.<br/><br/><b>Effusion</b> is the escape of fluid from the blood or lymphatic vessels into the surrounding tissues or into a body cavity.<br/><b>Pleural effusion</b> is excess fluid accumulating between the two pleural layers that surround the lungs.Pleural fluid is drawn out of the pleural space in a process called thoracentesis. A needle is inserted through the back of the chest wall in the sixth, seventh, or eighth intercostal space on the mid&#45;axillary line into the pleural space. The fluid may then be evaluated for the following:<ul><li>Chemical composition including protein, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), albumin, amylase, pH, and glucose</li><li>Gram stain and culture to identify possible bacterial infections</li><li>Total and differential cell counts</li><li>Cytopathology to identify cancer cells and to assist in identifying possible infective organisms</li><li>Other tests as suggested by the clinical situation &#45; lipids, fungal culture, viral culture and specific immunoglobulins</li></ul><br/><b>Joint effusion</b> is the presence of increased intra&#45;articular fluid, a fairly common finding in the inflamed knee joint, but any joint may be affected. It may happen as a result of trauma, inflammation, hematologic conditions or infections.<br/><b>Exudates and transudates</b><br/><b>An exudate</b> is any fluid that filters from the circulatory system into lesions or areas of inflammation.It is rich in the protein and cellular elements that ooze out of blood vessels due to inflammation and is deposited in surrounding tissues. The altered permeability of blood vessels permits the passage of large molecules and cells through the blood vessel walls<br/>.<b>A transudate</b> is an accumulation of fluid that passed through a membrane due to increased pressure in the veins and capillaries forcing the fluid through the vessel walls. This process filters out most of the protein and cellular elements, thus yielding a watery solution. Transudates are caused by disturbances of hydrostatic or colloid osmotic pressure and not by inflammation.There is an important distinction between transudates and exudates. Exudates have a higher protein content and thus a higher specific gravity, while transudates have a lower protein content and thus a lower specific gravity.<br/><br/><div align=center><hr align=center size=2 width=100%/></div><b>Pus</b><br/>Pus is a viscous, yellowish&#45;white fluid formed in infected tissue, consisting of white blood cells, cellular debris, necrotic tissue and masses of bacteria, both dead and alive.<br/><b>The following are recommended steps to take for sending a pus sample from a closed abscess to the microbiology lab for MC&amp;S (Microscopy, Culture and Sensitivity). </b><br/><b>Follow these steps:</b><br/><ul><li>Ensure sterile conditions and have relevant barrier techniques in place.</li><li>Test for fluctuation and determine the point of maximum fluctuation.</li><li>Clean the skin/mucosa with an appropriate antimicrobial agent.

The surrounding area may be sore and tender along the vein.<br/>Thrombophlebitis may be caused by damage to a vein&#39;s wall as a result of injecting substances that cause irritation or introduce bacteria into the vein from a contaminated needle/cannula as well as the prolonged insertion of a cannula for intravenous infusion.<br/>It usually starts with tenderness and redness along the superficial veins on the skin, showing as a red line as the inflammation follows the path of the superficial vein. It may ramify to smaller feeder veins as it progresses. On palpation, the vein will feel hard and warm with tenderness. The area will begin to burn and throb if acute inflammation ensues.
